    question: "Can I earn more in rewards than I pay in fees with Nuba?",
    answer: `For Businesses: \n Yes. The Nuba fee may be fully tax-deductible as a business expense, potentially reducing your end-of-year tax bill.

Paying rent through Nuba gives you flexibility and better cashflow management, helping you avoid late fees and arrears. Plus, if you’re great at spreading the word, you can earn enough Nuba Points from referrals to enjoy multiple months of free rent. \n Note: Benefits vary depending on your card type and provider.`,
